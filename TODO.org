* DONE Fix problem with undefined procedures in runlists not being recognized when they are defined.
* DONE Set up changing fonts.
* TODO Fix package issue (!)
- User stuff must go in logo-user so user code can't clash with
  builtin stuff in logo package or stuff in CL or XLIB. This is a
  major issue!
* TODO Use arbitrary fonts (bitmap for now)
- TTF/OTF only a gleam in my eye right now....
- Font rotation
* TODO Add procedures from UCBLogo
* TODO Add scheme for using muliple turtles
- A thread per turle
* TODO Add bitmaps (xpm)
* TODO Let the turtle be a bitmap
- Rotate bitmaps
* TODO Use emacs as a canvas?
- Possible but probably not practical.
* DONE Tests
- UCBLogo tests (where possible/appropriate)
* TODO Save screen as xpm file (xpm is easy; jpeg is harder)
* TODO More colors / better color scheme
* TODO Revisit errors
- Restarts
- Make all errors lead to logo toplevel
- Logo level debugger?
* TODO Distribution
- Github? Other? SBCL contrib??
* TODO Figure out if tail-recursion optimization is possible.
- Currently special bindings inhibit it.
  - Mechanically convert tail recursion to jumps? How?
